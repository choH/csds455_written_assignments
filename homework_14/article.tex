\section*{Problem 1}

\begin{proof}

\leavevmode\newline


    \begin{adjustwidth}{1cm}{}

    \begin{proof}
    \textbf{Lemma: For a graph with $\alpha(G)$ number of independent vertices, we have $\chi(G) \geq \frac{|V(G)|}{\alpha(G)}$}.\newline

    Say we color such graph $G$ with $\chi(G)$ colors and we group vertices according to their color. It is intuitive to tell that $\chi(G)$ will size of the color group with largest cardinality. Since vertices from different color group are not adjacent by definition, we know there will be $\alpha(G)$ color groups under the $\chi(G)$-colored $G$. Thus, it is save to say $|V(G)| \leq \alpha(G) \cdot \chi(G)$ as each color group can have at most $\chi(G)$ vertices and we have at most $\alpha(G)$ color groups. By doing a simple transformation we have $\chi(G) \geq \frac{|V(G)|}{\alpha(G)}$.




    \end{proof}

    \end{adjustwidth}

For the graph in question we have $|V(G)| = 3 \cdot 3 + 2 \cdot 2 = 13$, and we know that $\alpha(G) = 2$ as only two non-adjacent component will be independent from eachother, which implies $\chi(G) \geq \frac{13}{2} = 6.5 \Longrightarrow \chi(G) \geq 7$. The graph is 7-chromatic as demonstrated below (each number represents a color):

Now we want to show that this graph does not containa subdivision of 7-clique. Note that each ``component'' of $G$ has either 3 or 2 vertices and we know that a 7-clique has 7 vertices, this suggests that there should be at least two vertices in this 7-clique that are not adjacent to each other, but have 6-vertex-disjoint pathes between them.\newline

So now we are picking ``2-component'' pairs out of the graph, we have $A$ with $C/D$ (namely a triangle with another triangle), $C/D$ with $B/E$ (a triangle with an edge), or $E$ with $B$.

In the first case, we have 4 vertex-disjoint pathes from a vertex in $A$ to a vertex in $C/D$ (2 to $B$ and 2 to $E$), $4 < 6$ so this case won't hold up. Similiarily we have 5 vertex-disjoint pathes in the second case (3 from $D/C$ to $E/B$, 2 internally between $D$ and $C$), $5 < 6$ so the second case won't hold up either.

The third case has 6 vertex-disjoint pathes (as the edge is adjacent to two triangles). We need 7 of these vertices and we can find them by counting all vertices in ``components''$A, B, E$. Note as we were asked for subdivision of 7-clique, so we will need at least one extra vertex between between the above 7 vertices, however all vertices in $D, C$ (which are the only vertices left to use) do not meed this requirement as regardless which vertex you pick, if it is in $D$ is must go through $C$ and vice versa. Therefore this case eventually also won't hold up. \newline

And as we have showed the graph cannot have a subdivision of a 7-clique, we have completed the prove of the statement.

\end{proof}

\section*{Problem 2}

We first inspect the \textit{lemma} introduced in problem 1, we have $|V(G)| = 3 \cdot 5 = 15$ which implies $\chi(G) \leq \frac{15}{}$
