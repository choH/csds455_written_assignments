\section*{Problem 1}

Given a bipartite graph $G$ with partitions $U, V$. We will make a $G'$ with two new verticies $s, t$ where $S$ is directionally connected to all the verticies in $U$, likewise, $t$ is directionally connected to all the verticies in $V$. We direct all the edges from $U$ to $V$, then make all edges in this $G'$ with capacity of 1. We will find the maximum flow $f$ of this $G'$, where edges used in $f$ that is also in $G$ is the larges possible matching in $G$.\newline

We denote the edges used in $f$ that is also in $G$ as $M$. We know that $M$ is a matching as every edge from $U \to t$ in $f$ has a capacity of 1, since the input and output flow of a vertex is balanced, this menas if we have multiple verticies from $U$ that is connected to a same vertex in $v \in V$ in $M$, then we will know that edge $vt$ will have a $> 1$ flow in $f$, which is a contradiction to our flow capacity setup. So $M$ must be a matching of $G$.

We also know that $M$ is a maximum matching of $G$. Known $M$'s corresponding $f$ is the maximum flow of $G'$ and considered every edge in $G'$ has a flow value of 1. If we ever have a $M'$ that is a bigger matching than $M$, then it must have a corresponding $f'$ that has a bigger flow value than $f$ -- which is, again, a contradiction to the setting of $f$. So, $M$ must be the maximum matching of $G$.
